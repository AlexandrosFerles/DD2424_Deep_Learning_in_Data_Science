# DD2424_Deep_Learning_in_Data_Science

This repository contains sourcee code for the assignments of the KTH mSc Machine Learning DD2424 Deep Learning in Data Science course.  

Its main context is implementing some Deep Architectures and Deep Learning methods from scratch, mostly in the Python numpy Library.  

## Topics include:

Assignment 1: 1-layer network for MultiClass classification in the CIFAR-10 dataset, through gradient descent Cross-Entropy and SVM Loss optimization respectively.

Assignment 2: 2-layer network for MultiClass classification in the CIFAR-10 dataset, through gradient descent Cross-Entropy Loss optimization.

Assignment 3: k-layer network for MultiClass classification with batch normalization in the CIFAR-10 dataset, through gradient descent Cross-Entropy Loss optimization.

Assignment 4: Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network, re-producing text segments based on the first chapter of 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' book and Donald Trump's tweets.
